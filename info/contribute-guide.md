  This file is a quick guide on how to contribute to the Periodic Archive.
  <!--
  <br />
  <br />
  If any project is missing credits and/or you want it taken down, submit a pull request with the changes or DM shady#9999 on Discord.
  <br />
  <br />
  If you want to contribute a project yourself, the guide is located <a href="https://github.com/ProjectPeriodic/ThePeriodicArchive/blob/main/info/contribute-guide.md">here.</a>
  -->
  </p>

### Step One:
- Fork the archive's repository.
  - This will allow you to submit pull requests to the archive.

### Step Two:
- Upload your files to your forked repo.
  - Depending on what you're uploading, there are different formats.
    - If the file is a custom pak/mod, upload it under "/main/mods/ModName"
    - If the file is a private server/big project, upload it under "/main/projects/ProjectName"

### Step Three:
- Add a README file to your project folder based off of the template [here].
