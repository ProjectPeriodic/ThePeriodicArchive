<p align="center">
  This file is a quick guide on how to contribute to the Periodic Archive.
  <!--
  <br />
  <br />
  If any project is missing credits and/or you want it taken down, submit a pull request with the changes or DM shady#9999 on Discord.
  <br />
  <br />
  If you want to contribute a project yourself, the guide is located <a href="https://github.com/ProjectPeriodic/ThePeriodicArchive/blob/main/info/contribute-guide.md">here.</a>

  </p>

### Step One:
- Fork the archive's repository.
  - This will allow you to submit pull requests to the archive.

### Step Two:
- Upload your files to your forked repo.
  - Depending on what you're uploading, there are different formats.
    - If the file is a custom pak/mod, upload it under "/main/mods/ModName"
    - If the file is a private server/big project, upload it under "/main/projects/ProjectName"

### Step Three:
- Add a README file to your project folder based off of the template [here](https://github.com/ProjectPeriodic/ThePeriodicArchive/blob/main/info/README-template.md).

### Step Four:
- Submit your pull request to the main repository!
  - Note: We have the right to deny any addition to the archive, with or without reason.
    - We'll try our best to supply a reason though, don't worry!

<h1 align ="center" style="margin-top: 0px;">Basic Guidelines to Contributing</h1>
<p align="center">
  Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when contributing to the archive.
  <!--
  <br />
  <br />

### Make sure you have permission.
- Whether the project be your team's or someone else's, make sure you have the proper permission to add it to the archive.
- If you contribute a project without proper permission, it will be removed from the archive by the Project Periodic team.

### Give the proper credits.
- When contributing a project, make sure you list ***all*** of the project owners and creators.
  - Whether they created an XMPP service for a private server or they made a simple one-button launcher, they deserve to have the proper credit.

### Check before you pull!
- Before contributing to the archive, make sure the project you are adding isn't already in the archive.
- Also, make sure that you aren't overriding an already contributed project on accident. Keep your commits inside the project folder!

### Try to not contribute closed-source programs.
- The main purpose of the archive is for people to learn off of open-sourced projects.
- Currently, the only closed-source programs we accept are major well-known ones, such as Rift and ERA.
  - However, this will go on a case-by-case basis.
- This rule also applies to custom paks/mods. If you can, please upload the UE4 project files.

### Don't attempt to nuke the repository.
- Like seriously, we can just deny your pull request. It's not that hard.
